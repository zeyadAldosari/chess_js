**Chess Enigne**

**Overview**

This project is a JavaScript-based chess engine that can generate legal moves, evaluate positions, and play a complete game of chess. It is designed to be both educational and functional, providing a solid foundation for anyone looking to learn more about chess programming or to expand their own chess-related projects.

**Features**

Move Generation: Efficiently generates all legal moves for any given position.

Move Validation: Ensures that all moves generated are legal according to the rules of chess.

Evaluation Function: Simple static evaluation function to assess board positions.

Search Algorithms: Implements basic search techniques like Minimax and Alpha-Beta Pruning.

Principal Variation Search: Optimized move searching for better performance.

Customizable Depth: Set the depth of the search to balance between performance and strength.

User Interface: **Basic** UI to interact with the engine and play games against it.
